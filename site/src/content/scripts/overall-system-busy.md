--Ask some basic questions:-
--What is the Server Name, IP Address (Inventory), What is the Application Name? What is the criticality to the Application? (Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze)
--How many users are getting impacted?
--Since when are you having this issue?
--Is something specific running slow? What do you mean by slow, how did you measure it? Is a query slow, application slow, data retrieval slow?
--When was the last time the performance was good?
--Was there any change or major modification done to Code/Application from Developers Side?
