--full backup backup database databasename to disk = 'path\filename.bak'

--differential backup backup database databasename to disk = 'path\filename.bak' with differential

--transaction log backup backup log databasename to disk = 'path\filename.trn'

--tail log backup
--to perform tail log backup and keep the database in restoring state backup log databasename to disk = 'path\filename.trun' with norecovery
--or
--use this only when the database is damaged backup log databasename to disk = 'path\filename.trn' with no_truncate

with format

--to compress a backup backup database databasename to disk = 'path\filename.bak' with compression

--to take a backup with modified buffercount, buffersize and status
--buffer count range = 1 to int_max
--by default sql server uses buffer count of 7 (7 during taking backup and 6 during restoring the backup) and int_max means the maximum value of an int on the platform being used.
--buffer size (maxtransfersize) range = 64 KB to 4 MB and we should write in bytes, so 65536 bytes(64 KB) and 4194304 (4 MB)
--stats will tell how much the backup is completed 1 to 100, like every 5% or 10% and so on. based on the value that we want.
backup database databasename to disk = 'path\filename.bak'
with buffercount = 14, maxtransfersize = 4194304, stats = 5
