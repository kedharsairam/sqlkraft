To install a Service Broker service, the developer gives the administrator a set of installation

scripts. These scripts typically include the Transact-SQL statements that are required to create

the message types, contracts, queues, services, and stored procedures for the service.

Depending on the service, the developer might provide one set of scripts for the target service

and a different set of scripts for the initiating service.

First, the administrator reviews and executes the scripts. Then, the administrator configures the

security principals, certificates, remote service bindings, and routes required for the application

to work in a production environment.

The development or test environment might contain the same user names as the production

environment, but have different certificates associated with those users. This difference in

certificates provides an extra degree of isolation between the test environment and the

production environment, without requiring the Transact-SQL code to change for deployment.

Developers can test the exact code to be used in production without requiring that the

administrator provide the certificates used in the production environment.

As part of the installation process, the developer and the administrator should plan and

document the procedure to uninstall the application. Applications that use Service Broker

typically rely on Service Broker's guarantee of reliable messaging. Therefore, the developer and

the administrator must work together to outline a strategy for making sure that the application

processes all of the messages it has received before the administrator uninstalls the

application.
