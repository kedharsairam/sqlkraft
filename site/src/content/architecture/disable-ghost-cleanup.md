Ghost cleanup is a background process that physically removes the rows that were marked for

deletion by DML statements. The following article provides an overview of this process.

Rows that are deleted from the leaf level pages of an index aren't physically removed from the

page. Instead, the row is marked for future removal, or

ghosted

. This means that the row stays

on the page but a bit is changed in the row header to indicate that the row is a ghost. This is to

optimize performance during a delete operation. Ghosts are necessary for row-level locking

and for snapshot isolation transactions where the database engine must maintain older row

versions.

Rows that are marked for deletion, or

ghosted

, are cleaned up by the background ghost

cleanup process when they're no longer required. Ghost cleanup runs periodically and checks

to see if any pages have ghosted rows. If it finds any, it physically removes these rows. There's

a single ghost cleanup thread for all databases on a Database Engine instance.

When a row is ghosted, the database is marked as having ghosted entries. The ghost cleanup

process only scans such databases. The ghost cleanup process also marks the database as

having no ghosted rows once all ghosted rows are removed, and skips this database the next

time it runs. The process also skips any database if it can't acquire a shared lock on the

database. It retries lock acquisition on the database the next time it runs.

The following query returns an approximate number of ghosted rows in a database.

SQL

In high-load systems with many deletes, the ghost cleanup process might reduce performance

if it replaces many of the frequently accessed pages in the buffer pool with other pages that

have ghosted rows. As a result, the frequently accessed pages must be re-read from disk,

generating extra disk I/O and increasing query latency. If this occurs, you can disable ghost

cleanup using

trace flag 661

.

Without ghost cleanup, your database can grow unnecessarily large, which can also reduce

performance due to extra I/O and memory consumption. Since the ghost cleanup process

removes rows that are marked as ghosts, disabling the process leaves these rows on the page,

preventing the database engine from reusing this space. This forces the database engine to

add data to new pages instead, leading to bloated database files, and can also cause

page

splits

. Page splits increase disk I/O, which can reduce query performance. If ghost cleanup is

disabled, the database might run out of space.

To remove ghost rows when ghost cleanup is disabled, rebuild indexes on tables where rows

were deleted. Rebuilding an index creates new pages from existing data, omitting ghosted

rows in the process.

Warning

Disabling the ghost cleanup process permanently isn't recommended.
